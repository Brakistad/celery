# SplineSandbox

Welcome to SplineSandbox, where mathematical creativity meets practical application! üöÄ

## About SplineSandbox

SplineSandbox is a collaborative project that bridges the gap between researchers and developers, allowing them to explore advanced mathematical concepts, especially splines, while seamlessly transitioning from research to production. Whether you're a mathematician exploring the elegance of mathematical curves or a developer implementing these mathematical insights into real-world applications, SplineSandbox provides the perfect environment for innovation.

## Features

‚ú® **Flexible Workflow**: Researchers can create Jupyter notebooks in the `workbooks` folder to explore mathematical concepts in a familiar environment. Developers can build a production-ready application in the `app` folder using these same concepts.

üîó **Seamless Collaboration**: SplineSandbox encourages collaboration between researchers and developers, ensuring that both can contribute to the project using their preferred tools and methodologies.

üìä **Mathematical Exploration**: Dive deep into mathematical concepts like splines, curves, and more. Use Jupyter notebooks for interactive research and experimentation.

üåê **Production-Ready Applications**: Transform your mathematical discoveries into production-grade applications that can be used in real-world scenarios.

üì¶ **Dev Container**: We provide a pre-configured development container for a consistent and hassle-free setup. No more "It works on my machine" issues!
