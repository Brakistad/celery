# Workbooks in SplineSandbox

Welcome to the Workbooks section of the SplineSandbox project! Workbooks are Jupyter notebooks that allow researchers to explore and document mathematical concepts in an interactive and reproducible manner.

## Introduction

In this directory, you will find a collection of Jupyter notebooks that cover various mathematical concepts. Each notebook is designed to guide you through specific mathematical topics and experiments.

## How to Use the Workbooks

To use the workbooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the SplineSandbox repository to your local machine if you haven't already:

   \```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SplineSandbox.git
   \```

2. Navigate to the `./workbooks` directory:

   \```bash
   cd SplineSandbox/workbooks
   \```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook by running:

   \```bash
   jupyter notebook
   \```

   This will open a web browser with a directory listing of available notebooks.

4. Click on a notebook file (with the `.ipynb` extension) to open it.

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore and experiment with mathematical concepts.

6. Document your findings, add code, and run cells interactively.

7. Save your changes and create your own notebooks as needed.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions to the workbooks! If you have a mathematical concept or experiment you'd like to share, feel free to create a new notebook or enhance existing ones. Collaborate with fellow researchers and developers to enrich our mathematical knowledge.

Happy exploring and documenting! ðŸ§®ðŸ“Š
